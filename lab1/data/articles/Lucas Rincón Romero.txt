General Lucas Rincón Romero was the highest-ranking Venezuelan military officer at the time of the 2002 coup d'état attempt against Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. He announced in a television broadcast that Chávez had resigned, "se le solicitó al señor presidente la renuncia de su cargo, la cual aceptó." (The president was asked to resign his post, which he accepted.) He was one of Chavez's most loyal military officers.Chávez was returned to power within three days and there has since been debate as to whether the resignation, not known to exist in writing, was genuine. Chávez said in a BBC interview in October 2005  that media reports that he had renounced his position were false. Rincón went on to become the Minister of Interior and Justice (January 2003 - September 2004).
