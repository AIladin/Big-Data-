For a more general — but much more technical — treatment of tangent vectors, see tangent space.In mathematics, a tangent vector is a vector that is tangent to a curve or surface at a given point. Tangent vectors are described in the differential geometry of curves in the context of curves in Rn. More generally, tangent vectors are elements of a tangent space of a differentiable manifold. Tangent vectors can also be described in terms of germs. Formally, a tangent vector at the point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a linear derivation of the algebra defined by the set of germs at 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  .


== Motivation ==
Before proceeding to a general definition of the tangent vector, we discuss its use in calculus and its tensor properties.


=== Calculus ===
Let 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} (t)}
   be a parametric smooth curve. The tangent vector is given by 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            ′
          
        
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} ^{\prime }(t)}
  , where we have used a prime instead of the usual dot to indicate differentiation with respect to parameter t. The unit tangent vector is given by

  
    
      
        
          T
        
        (
        t
        )
        =
        
          
            
              
                
                  r
                
                
                  ′
                
              
              (
              t
              )
            
            
              
                |
              
              
                
                  r
                
                
                  ′
                
              
              (
              t
              )
              
                |
              
            
          
        
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {T} (t)={\frac {\mathbf {r} ^{\prime }(t)}{|\mathbf {r} ^{\prime }(t)|}}\,.}
